### Project Overview: AR Interior Design

**Objective**: Create an augmented reality app that lets users visualize furniture and decor in their own homes using their mobile devices.

**Tools/Technologies**:
- **Unity**: Game development platform for creating 3D and 2D games and interactive experiences.
- **Vuforia**: AR platform that enables apps to see and interact with real-world objects.
- **ARKit/ARCore**: Apple's and Google's AR development platforms for iOS and Android, respectively.
- **C#**: Programming language used within Unity.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up Unity and Vuforia

1. **Install Unity**: Download and install the latest version of Unity from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/).
2. **Create a New Project**: Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
3. **Install Vuforia**: In Unity, go to the Unity Asset Store and search for Vuforia Engine. Download and import it into your project.
4. **Enable Vuforia**: Go to `Edit > Project Settings > XR Settings` and check the "Vuforia Augmented Reality" option.

#### Step 2: Configure Vuforia

1. **Vuforia License Key**: Sign up on the [Vuforia Developer Portal](https://developer.vuforia.com/), create a new license key, and copy it.
2. **Add AR Camera**: Delete the default main camera in the scene. Add a Vuforia AR Camera by going to `GameObject > Vuforia Engine > AR Camera`. Paste your license key in the AR Camera component in the Inspector.

#### Step 3: Set Up Image Targets

1. **Image Targets**: These are the images that Vuforia will track and use to place 3D models in the real world.
2. **Upload Image**: In the Vuforia Developer Portal, go to the Target Manager, create a new database, and upload the images you want to use as targets. Download the database and import it into Unity.
3. **Add Image Target**: In Unity, go to `GameObject > Vuforia Engine > Image Target`. Select your database and image target from the dropdown in the Image Target Behaviour component.

#### Step 4: Add 3D Furniture Models

1. **Import 3D Models**: Download or create 3D models of furniture in FBX format and import them into your Unity project.
2. **Place Models**: Drag the 3D models into the hierarchy, making them children of the Image Target GameObject. Adjust their position, rotation, and scale as needed.

#### Step 5: Scripting

1. **Add Interactivity**: Create a C# script to allow users to interact with the 3D models (e.g., move, rotate, scale). Here’s a simple script to move a furniture model.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class FurnitureInteraction : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Vector3 offset;
    private float dist;
    private Transform toDrag;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.touchCount == 1)
        {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);
            Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(touch.position);
            RaycastHit hit;

            if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began)
            {
                if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
                {
                    if (hit.collider.CompareTag("Furniture"))
                    {
                        dist = hit.transform.position.z - Camera.main.transform.position.z;
                        toDrag = hit.transform;
                        offset = toDrag.position - ray.GetPoint(dist);
                    }
                }
            }
            if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Moved && toDrag != null)
            {
                Vector3 point = ray.GetPoint(dist) + offset;
                toDrag.position = point;
            }
            if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Ended)
            {
                toDrag = null;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Attach Script**: Attach the script to the 3D furniture models. Add a collider to the models if they don’t have one and tag them as "Furniture".

#### Step 6: Build and Test

1. **Build Settings**: Go to `File > Build Settings`, switch the platform to either iOS or Android depending on your target device, and add the current scene.
2. **Player Settings**: In the Player Settings, configure the necessary settings for your target platform (e.g., bundle identifier, orientation).
3. **Build and Run**: Connect your mobile device to your computer, build and run the app on the device, and test the AR functionalities.

### Final Touches

- **UI Elements**: Add UI elements to help users interact with the app (e.g., buttons to change furniture models, adjust scale).
- **Optimization**: Optimize the 3D models and app performance for smoother AR experience.
- **User Feedback**: Test the app with users and gather feedback to improve the user experience.

### Conclusion

This project provides a basic framework for creating an AR Interior Design app using Unity and Vuforia.
